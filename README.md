# Overview

The goal is for a user to have their name added to the traditional Hello, World statement. 

I am using the latest version of Python and Visual Studio Code. 

It's been some time since I coded a basic Python program so this was a refresher for the fundamentals. 

Below you will find a link to a YouTube video walkthrough of my program and how it functions.
